https://liamwm.github.io/sudoku-solver/

A sudoku solver written in Prolog that runs in the browser, using [the SWI-Prolog WebAssembly port](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=wasm). The React-powered puzzle editor UI allows you to easily specify the partially-filled sudoku you need to solve. This tool can also be used as a way to test whether a solution exists for a given sudoku. The UI is still a work-in-progress.
